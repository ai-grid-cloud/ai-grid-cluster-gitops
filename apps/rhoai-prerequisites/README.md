# RHOAI prerequisites

This app distributes the RHOAI installation prerequisites to every cluster
in the reserved `global` ACM cluster set:

- the protected `redhat-ai-grid` and `redhat-ods-operator` Namespaces;
- image-mirror enforcement on conventional clusters and validation of service-managed
  mirror mappings on hosted control planes;
- the `openshift-marketplace/rhoai-catalog-pull-secret` required to pull the
  RHOAI catalog image;
- merged `openshift-config/pull-secret` entries for `quay.io/rhoai`, required
  for mirrored operator-bundle pulls, and for every other registry the hub
  Secret holds, such as `registry.stage.redhat.io` for the
  `registry.redhat.io/rhaii*` mirrors that model images pull through.
- the Limitador Redis configuration, on remote ingress and combined sites only, that shares MaaS rate-limit
  counters through the Submariner service import.
- the hub-only `rhai-metrics` addon registration and, on enabled grid sites,
  the NetworkPolicy admitting the local ACM agents to each RHOAI collector's
  HTTPS exporter on port 8889. It retries until RHOAI creates its monitoring
  namespace and replaces the hub-only policy in `ai-grid-o11y`; the initial
  prune/reconcile handoff can briefly interrupt these scrapes. Do not also
  deploy an ApplicationSet managing that NetworkPolicy. Only the addon's copied
  scrape pool keeps targets, preventing duplicate collection on the hub.
  Removing the registration policy does not withdraw its addon tuple; that
  requires a separate migration preserving the other configs.
- temporary cert-manager permissions for the OpenTelemetry operator on enabled Grid sites
  with role `ingress`, `inference` or `combined`, including an enabled hub.
- the catalog ServiceAccount's `imagePullSecrets` wiring is managed by
  `apps/rhoai/catalog`; OLM does not update an already-created catalog
  ServiceAccount when `CatalogSource.spec.secrets` changes.

The Quay credentials are never stored in Git. The pull-secret policy uses an
ACM hub template to check for `rhoai-prerequisites/rhoai-quay-pull-secret`
before rendering the remote Secret. Until that hub Secret exists and contains
a non-empty `.dockerconfigjson` key, the pull-secret policy has no remote
object templates and makes no changes on managed clusters. The image mirror is
still distributed because it does not contain credentials.

## Clean-cluster flow

`bootstrap.sh` seeds only the hub-side credential Secret. The root
ApplicationSet then discovers this app, ACM applies the prerequisites to every
cluster in the `global` cluster set, and the RHOAI ApplicationSet deploys after
them. Conventional clusters receive mirror configuration directly. Hosted control
planes require service-managed mirror configuration before installation; see
[hosted control plane image mirrors](#hosted-control-plane-image-mirrors).

The global pull-secret policy is idempotent. It reads the current
`openshift-config/pull-secret`, preserves every existing credential, and
adds the hub-side entries it lacks: `quay.io/rhoai` from the Quay credential,
and any other registry the hub Secret holds. A bare `quay.io` entry in the hub
Secret is applied only as `quay.io/rhoai`, so the cluster's own `quay.io` login
stays. Updating that Secret triggers the normal Machine Config
Operator rollout to each node.

## Hosted control plane image mirrors

On clusters whose `Infrastructure/cluster.status.controlPlaneTopology` is
`External`, image mirrors are owned by the hosting service. ROSA HCP admission
rejects guest-cluster creation, update or deletion of ImageDigestMirrorSets.
Configure digest mirrors through the supported service API before RHOAI
installation; additional guest RBAC does not bypass that restriction.

For ROSA HCP, authenticate `rosa` against the cluster's OCM environment and
select the target HCP cluster. These commands were checked with ROSA CLI 1.2.67:

```sh
export ROSA_CLUSTER='<hcp-cluster-name-or-id>'
rosa list image-mirrors --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" -o json
```

Inspect existing records first. For each missing source, create its mapping:

```sh
rosa create image-mirror --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" \
  --source registry.redhat.io/rhoai --mirrors quay.io/rhoai
rosa create image-mirror --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" \
  --source registry.redhat.io/rhaii --mirrors registry.stage.redhat.io/rhaii
rosa create image-mirror --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" \
  --source registry.redhat.io/rhaii-early-access --mirrors registry.stage.redhat.io/rhaii-early-access
rosa create image-mirror --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" \
  --source registry.redhat.io/rhaii-fast --mirrors registry.stage.redhat.io/rhaii-fast
```

If a source already exists, retain its record and use
`rosa edit image-mirror --cluster "$ROSA_CLUSTER" --id '<mirror-id>' --mirrors '<complete-mirror-list>'`
when an update is needed. Editing replaces the mirror list; preserve any
existing mirrors that are still required rather than creating duplicate sources.

The `rhoai-image-mirror` ConfigurationPolicy renders an unnamed object template
on External control planes. ACM evaluates unnamed templates in inform mode,
even though this shared policy otherwise enforces prerequisites. It checks for
one ImageDigestMirrorSet containing all four mappings, without creating or
changing the service-owned resource or requiring its name to be `quay-registry`.
Missing mappings remain NonCompliant. Mappings split across multiple IDMS
objects are not covered by this check. Inspect the service's resulting objects:

```sh
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" get imagedigestmirrorsets -o yaml
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" -n rhoai-prerequisites \
  get configurationpolicy rhoai-image-mirror
```

Conventional control planes retain named `quay-registry` enforcement with
`NeverContactSource`. The ROSA CLI does not expose an equivalent fallback-policy
setting, so the HCP check does not require `mirrorSourcePolicy` or claim the
same source-fallback behavior. Mirror pruning is disabled for both topologies
so policy removal and topology transitions retain service- and administrator-owned
mirror resources; removing obsolete mappings requires a deliberate ownership review.

Mirror configuration does not deliver registry credentials to HCP workers.
The separate HCP worker pull-secret integration is tracked in
[RHAI-18763](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHAI-18763); a Compliant mirror
policy alone does not establish that mirrored image pulls succeed.

Run the local rendering checks with Helm and PyYAML:

```sh
python3 apps/rhoai-prerequisites/tests/image-mirror-test.py
```

## OpenTelemetry cert-manager compatibility

The compatibility grant uses `openshift-opentelemetry-operator`, explicitly set in
`apps/rhoai/values.yaml`. A custom operator namespace requires updating the policy's
ServiceAccount subject as well. The grant mirrors [RHOAI's supplemental RBAC](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-observability/blob/f7050b59693a1a12da127cbb757d75fa4d125ef5/charts/odh-observability/templates/opentelemetry-cert-manager-rbac.yaml).

OTel caches cert-manager discovery and authorization at startup; Argo sync waves
do not guarantee these prerequisites are ready first. If OTel started too early,
confirm policy compliance, cert-manager API availability and operator permissions.
Replace webhook pods one at a time, maintaining a Ready serving replica and
waiting for each replacement to be Ready; verify webhook
endpoints, then replace controller pods one at a time and wait for readiness.
OLM can revert `rollout restart`.
Allow RHOAI to retry, then verify collector/allocator readiness, Certificates,
Monitoring Ready at its current generation, and collector scrape targets.

Retire the workaround only after equivalent product-owned access is verified.
The policy retains its RBAC on deletion or deselection; explicitly remove the
compatibility ClusterRoleBinding and ClusterRole through GitOps during retirement.

## Shared Limitador Redis

`apps/limitador-redis` owns the Redis instance and its local Limitador storage
configuration on the hub. On every other managed cluster, the
`rhoai-limitador-redis` Policy creates the `limitador-redis` namespace needed
for the Submariner `ServiceImport`, the `kuadrant-system/limitador-redis`
Secret, and the `Limitador/limitador` Redis storage reference. Remote
Limitadors therefore use:

```text
redis://limitador-redis-master.limitador-redis.svc.clusterset.local:6379
```

The local Redis NetworkPolicy permits Submariner GlobalNet traffic
(`242.0.0.0/8`). The policy intentionally excludes the hub so the
existing local Argo Application remains the sole owner of the Redis and local
Limitador storage resources.

## Create the hub Secret

Set `RHOAI_QUAY_PULL_SECRET` to the base64-encoded `username:password` value
that can pull both the RHOAI catalog and operator-bundle repositories, then
run:

```sh
export HUB_CONTEXT='<hub-kubeconfig-context>'
read -s RHOAI_QUAY_PULL_SECRET
export RHOAI_QUAY_PULL_SECRET

apps/rhoai-prerequisites/create-hub-secret.sh
```

ACM watches the hub Secret and reconciles the policy after it is created or
updated. Removing the hub Secret does not delete an already-created pull Secret
on a managed cluster; this avoids accidentally removing credentials because of
a temporary hub-side Secret outage.

## Verify

Use metadata-only commands so the credential is not displayed:

```sh
kubectl --context "$HUB_CONTEXT" -n rhoai-prerequisites get secret rhoai-quay-pull-secret \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,TYPE:.type'
kubectl --context "$HUB_CONTEXT" -n rhoai-prerequisites get placementdecisions
kubectl --context "$HUB_CONTEXT" get policies -n rhoai-prerequisites
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" -n openshift-config get secret pull-secret \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,TYPE:.type'
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" -n rhoai-prerequisites get configurationpolicy \
  rhoai-global-pull-secret
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" -n limitador-redis get serviceimport \
  limitador-redis-master
kubectl --context "$SPOKE_CONTEXT" -n kuadrant-system get limitador limitador \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.storage.redis.configSecretRef.name}{"\n"}'
```
