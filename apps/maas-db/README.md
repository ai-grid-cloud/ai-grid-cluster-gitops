# MaaS shared PostgreSQL database

This app defines the shared PostgreSQL database for `maas-api`. CloudNativePG
runs a three-instance writable cluster on `local-cluster`, and an ACM-generated
Argo CD Application defines a one-instance read-only replica for every other
registered managed cluster.

Generated Applications sync automatically and self-heal configuration drift,
but do not prune resources that are removed from Git. This keeps the initial
database rollout GitOps-managed without exposing existing database resources to
automated deletion.

## Topology

- The writable primary is `maas-db` in the `maas-db` namespace on
  `local-cluster`.
- The `maas-db-rw` Service is exported through Submariner as
  `maas-db-rw.maas-db.svc.clusterset.local`.
- The primary server certificate includes the Submariner service name so remote
  replicas can use `sslmode=verify-full`.
- Every managed cluster gets the Submariner add-on through the
  `acm-submariner` ApplicationSet, so new clusters are onboarded automatically.
- Each remote cluster runs `maas-read`, a CloudNativePG replica cluster using
  `pg_basebackup` and continuous TLS streaming replication.
- `local-cluster` exposes `maas-read-ro` as an ExternalName to its local
  CloudNativePG read-only Service. Every cluster therefore has the same read
  endpoint:

```text
maas-read-ro.maas-db.svc.cluster.local:5432
```

- `maas-api` reads `maas-db-config` from its own namespace. The Secret has
  `DB_CONNECTION_URL` for the writable service and
  `DB_READ_CONNECTION_URL` for the local read-only service.
- CloudNativePG generates the replication client certificate, CA, and
  application credentials on `local-cluster`. ACM policies copy them to remote
  clusters without storing plaintext secrets in Git.
- New managed clusters are selected automatically through the `global` cluster
  set. Argo CD creates a replica Application for each ACM-registered cluster.

## Rollout

The app depends on the existing ACM GitOps integration that creates Argo CD
cluster Secrets with the `apps.open-cluster-management.io/acm-cluster: "true"`
label. After pushing the app, Argo CD syncs `maas-db` automatically. The
ApplicationSet creates:

- `maas-db-local-cluster` for the writable primary.
- One `maas-db-<cluster-name>` Application for each remote managed cluster.

The replication-secret policy selects only remote clusters; on
`local-cluster`, CloudNativePG owns the generated secrets directly. The
API-credential policy runs on all clusters and creates or updates the
`maas-db-config` Secret expected by `maas-api`.

Keep the API-credential policy enabled only after the writable primary and
local read endpoint have passed validation. If an older PostgreSQL instance is
already in use, export and restore its data into the new primary before
syncing this policy.

## Validation

After the generated Applications sync, verify their status:

```sh
kubectl get applications.argoproj.io -n openshift-gitops
kubectl get clusters.postgresql.cnpg.io -n maas-db
kubectl get policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io -n maas-db
```

On a remote cluster, confirm streaming replication:

```sh
kubectl get cluster maas-read -n maas-db -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}{"\n"}'
```

The phase should be `Cluster in healthy state`. Backups and point-in-time
recovery are not configured by this app and should be added before using the
database for production data.

After the writable primary and every read replica are healthy, validate
connectivity from the database namespace. The `maas-db-api-credentials` Policy
and PlacementBinding can then remain enabled to create or update
`maas-db-config` through GitOps.

## Who can connect

`maas-db-rw` is exported to every cluster in the cluster set. A
NetworkPolicy (`40-network-policy.yaml`) keeps other pods on the hub out: it
admits the namespace's own pods, maas-api's namespaces, the CloudNativePG
operator, monitoring, the router on 8080 for Keycloak, and Submariner Globalnet
addresses (242.0.0.0/8, the Broker's default range) on 5432 for other
clusters' replicas and maas-api. Every pod on a joined cluster egresses from
that range, so across clusters the boundary is the password: maas-api logs in
with SCRAM bound to the TLS channel (`channel_binding=require`). A spoke's
replica admits no other cluster.

The database pods carry `app=postgres`, which maas-api's egress policy
requires in MaaS builds that restrict egress. That covers a database on
maas-api's own cluster; for a remote spoke's maas-api, which reaches the
hub's primary by its clusterset name, the credential Policy also adds
`maas-api-to-clusterset-db`, an egress rule for the primary's Globalnet
address.
